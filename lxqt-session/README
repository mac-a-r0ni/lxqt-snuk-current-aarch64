First of all there's session manager lxqt-session. 
The binary is launched right at the beginning of LXQt sessions and in turn responsible for launching and monitoring all other components constituting the sessions.

GUI "LXQt Session Settings" (binary lxqt-config-session) is used to configure various settings affecting the session, 
e. g. which window manager to use or which applications to start automatically.

Binary lxqt-leave deals with interrupting or terminating sessions. It comes with several options expressing the action they trigger, 
e. g. --leave, --hibernate, --shutdown or --reboot.

LXQt Modules

Term "LXQt Modules" refers to a way to launch binaries at the beginning of LXQt sessions and to make sure these will be available all over the session.
Technically those binaries are basically launched according to the XDG Autostart Specification. 
But unlike binaries handled according to this specification only LXQt Modules are monitored all over the session and automatically relaunched should they exit unexpectedly.
